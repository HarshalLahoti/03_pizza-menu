IMP point to be considered
1. index.js is imp as web pack which is bundled uses as enty point for project
2. React strict mode is nothing but during development it will render the componet twice to find out any bugs.
   Also it will tell us if we are using any depricated api.
3. Debugging in React
    - check if npm is started or not in the terminal
    - restart the terminal . Ctrl + C
    - refresh the browser
    - inspect in the browser
    - use eslint
4. We write componets in React using functions which should have first letter capital while naming the componet.
The component should return only one markup or jsx.

5. Nexting conponets doesn't mean we write component defination or function declartion in one other.
Just call the name of component into another.

6. Traditional way we kept HTML Css and javascript is separate places. JSX combines HTML, CSS, javascript 
into one single block of code which is used React. The reason behind this is earlier javacript was tightly 
coupled with HTMl. so react creted components which will combine them.

7. component is have its own, data, logic and appreance

8. TO include external css we just need to do import "./index.css";

9. Props is essentially how we pass data from one component to another. In particular from parent component to 
child component

10. Props are immutable that is its read only. so child component cannot change the data. to change we need
 state. WHy is this because props are nothing but object and mutate the copy , the original copy will also get
 mutated this will create a problem.

11. In react we have one -way data flow which from top to bottom using props
